**Coverage**: Production-scale validation with performance targets, memory efficiency, and concurrent load testing.

## Build System Integration

### CMake Configuration
- **File**: `tests/integration/CMakeLists.txt`
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- All integration tests properly integrated with GoogleTest
- Custom targets: `integration_tests`, `run_integration_tests`
- Proper dependencies and test labels configured

### Test Execution Targets
```bash
make integration_tests        # Build all integration test executables
make run_integration_tests    # Run all integration tests with output
ctest -L integration          # Run integration tests via CTest
```

## API Compatibility Resolution

### Challenge
Initial implementation used assumed API structures that didn't match the actual ARM SMMU v3 implementation.

### Solution
- Created `test_integration_base.h` helper for common functionality
- Implemented `test_minimal_integration.cpp` with correct API usage
- Validated actual API structures:
  - `Result<T>` uses `isOk()` not `isSuccess()`
  - `PagePermissions` has only `read`, `write`, `execute` fields
  - `StreamConfig` has simplified structure
  - `SMMUConfiguration` uses getter/setter methods

### Current Status
- **Minimal Integration Test**: ✅ **PASSING** (5 test cases, 100% success rate)
- **Full Test Suite**: ⚠️ **API ADAPTATION REQUIRED**

## Test Results

### Current Passing Tests
```
Test project /home/jgreninger/Work/smmu/build
    Start 11: test_minimal_integration
1/1 Test #11: test_minimal_integration .........   Passed    0.00 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 1
```

### Minimal Integration Test Coverage
1. **BasicStreamConfiguration** - Stream setup and enable/disable
2. **BasicPASIDAndTranslation** - PASID creation and translation
3. **BasicStreamIsolation** - Multi-stream isolation validation  
4. **BasicFaultHandling** - Fault detection and event recording
5. **BasicCacheStatistics** - Cache operation validation
